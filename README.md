# DataVis
Interesting Projects from DataVisConcepts(snall e)/DataVisAnalysis(capital E) classes using Bokeh (the JavaScript Methods like "js_on_change" were banned). The Comments are sometimes instructions. The programs are not created to be as general as possible but to fit to the criteria. We were instructed to submit .py files, which is why I did not use jupyter. <br>
Most of the plots are interactive. (if possible I added an .html + there are Screenshots in the folders)<br>
I did not include all the DataSets as I don't know if I have the rights to do so.

example:
## 1 (Corona Tests CH):

## 2 (Daily Corona Cases per Canton):

## 3 (k-medoids):

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me + some of the mistakes in the comments are not from me.
