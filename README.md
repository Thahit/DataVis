# DataVis
Interesting Projects from DataVisConcepts(snall letter)/DataVisAnalysis(capital letter) classes using Bokeh. The Comments are sometimes instructions. The programs are not created to be as general as possible but to fit to the criteria. <br>
Most of the plots are interactive. (if possible i added an .html + there are Screenshots in the folders)<br>
I did not include all the DataSets as I don't know if I have the rights to do so.

example:

![](/ex3/ScreeenShot1.png)

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me + some of the mistakes in the comments are not from me.
